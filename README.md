# Svelte todo list component

## Small todo component to see how [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) is doing

- Insane state management (coming from React)
- Nice suport for typescript and scss
- Cool "architecture" with the .svelte files
- Native transition API.. ðŸ˜® (charming experience!!!)
- Awesome work from [Rich Harris](https://github.com/Rich-Harris) and the [Community](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte) ðŸ’™
- Would use again 11/10
